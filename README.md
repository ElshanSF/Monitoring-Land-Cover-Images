# Monitoring Land Cover Changes Using Satellite Images
In the face of rapid urban development and climate change, it is now more urgent than ever for governments (and other organizations) to have a detailed, accurate and up-to-date picture of land use and land cover, as well as how the land use/cover is changing over time, in order to make an effective policy decision to manage and protect natural resources. Building such a comprehensive picture of land use/cover for a large region is extremely difficult. 

Recent improvements in satellite imagery and image process have allowed for new tools in land use/cover analysis. The following is an image of the change in vegetation cover around Belize from 1975 to 2007:

In this problem, we will explore how to use classifiers to detect the presence and location of vegetation in satellite images.


### Part 1(a): Detecting vegetation in satellite images

The following files contain sampled locations from satelite aeriel images: `dataset_1.txt`, ... `dataset_4.txt`. The first two columns contain the normalized latitude and longitude values. The last column indicates whether or not the location contains vegetation, with 1 indicating the presence of vegetaion and 0 indicating otherwise. 

These small sets of labels are typically generated by hand (that is, locations might be classified based on field studies or by cross-referencing with government databases). Your task is to use the labeled locations to train a model that will predict whether a new location is vegetation or non-vegetation.
Part 1(b). What is the best splitting criterion for decision trees?
Suppose you are given a data set with 100 points in a satellite image, of which 51 are class 1 and 49 are class 0. Consider following two candidate splits for constructing a decision tree: 
1. [Part 1 = (Class 1: 11, Class 0: 37), Part 2 = (Class 1: 40, Class 0: 12)]
2. [Part 1 = (Class 1: 25, Class 0: 48), Part 2 (Class 1: 26, Class 0: 1)]

Which of these is a better split according classification error, Gini coefficient, and Entropy criteria? Do the three criteria agree on the best split, or is one better than the other?
